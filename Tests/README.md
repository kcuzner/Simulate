Simulate Tests
--------------

This tests the backend model logic for the Simulate project. Mainly it will
test the provided blocks in the Engine project along with verification of
basic engine functionality (for both SimpleEngine and ThreadedEngine). Bugs
found in the project should have a unit test made that can identify them so
as to facilitate regression testing.
